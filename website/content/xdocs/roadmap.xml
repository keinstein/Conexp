            <title>Version 1.4 </title>
            <p>Currently the following features are planned for the 1.4 release:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implication and association rule navigator with support for rule
        selection and filtering</li>
                <li>Background implication set specification and editing for context</li>

            <title>Next versions</title>
            <p> The features are listed in a no particular order. The ordering of the features will be defined on the base of
 user requests and how fast the feature can be implemented. It can be that some features will be not implemented at all.</p>
