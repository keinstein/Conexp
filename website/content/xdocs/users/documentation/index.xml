      <title>Working with Concept Explorer</title>
      <p>The ConExp user interface consists of the following parts:
      <ul>
      <li>The <em>Menu</em> which is self-explanatory.</li>
      <li>The <em>Main toolbar</em> which contains buttons for global application operation as there are:
          <ul>
          <li>Create a new document;</li>
          <li>Open;</li>
          <li>Save;</li>
          <li>Compute the number of formal concepts;</li>
          <li>Compute the concept lattice;</li>
          <li>Perform the attribute exploration;</li>
          <li>Calculate the Duquenne-Guigues set of implications;</li>
          <li>Calculate association rules;</li>
          </ul>
additionally we have to mention the combo box which allows to select the update mode for the document components that are computed from the formal context (concept lattice, set of implications and association rules). Currently two update modes are supported. Those are <em>re-computation</em> of the affected components or <em>clear</em> them. The latter mode is recommended when changing the context reasonably. After realisation of those changes the appropriate operations can be reoptained for the new context.
In the case of many changes the other option would cause a re-computation for every single alteration of the context and may lead to computational expenses if the context is big or dense.</li>
      <li>The <em>main pane</em> consists of the following items: </li>
          <ul>
          <li><em>Document-tree</em>: It displays the structure of the current document and allows to navigate between different views (i.e. context, concept lattice, implications and association rules).</li>
          <li><em>Option-pane</em>: It allows to edit different options corresponding to the actual view.</li>
          <li><em>View-pane</em>: It contains the display for the current view. There is a toolbar with specific operations for each view.</li>
          </ul>
      <li>Statusbar</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <strong>Creating a new document</strong>
      <p>When starting ConExp a new document is created. Alternatively, one can create a new document by pressing the button <em>New context</em> on main toolbar or selecting the menu item <em>New</em> in <em>Files</em> menu. If a user chooses to open a new document, while working with another that contains unsaved changes, he is asked to save it (or to cancel creating the new document) before creating the new document.</p>
      <strong>Opening existing documents</strong>
      <p>ConExp allows to work with several different data formats. Currently the following formats are supported:
      <ul>
      <li>ConExp native format *.cex: This is an XML-based format. It stores information about the context and the lattice line diagram. In addition to the others it stores the information whether implications and/or association rules were calculated. We recommend to use this format.</li>
      <li>ConImp context data *.cxt: It is possible to work with contexts, that were created using <em>ConImp</em>. The disadvantage is, only the context can be encoded in this format.</li>
      <li>Comma Separated Values *.csv: So far ConExp supports only the import of contexts in this format. Actual separator is semicolon (;). It is assumed, that the first line of the file contains attributes names and the first cell is empty. (I.e, if one has a context with attributes attr1 and attr2, then first line will be the following: <em>;attr1;attr2</em>.) Each of the succeeding lines should start with an object name followed by a sequence of 0s and 1s. A cross will appearer in all cells of the imported context, where a 1 has been set.</li>
      <li>Object Attribute List *.oal: So far ConExp supports only the import of contexts in this format. Each line contains information on one object starting with the name and followed-up by the possessed attributes. If object obj1 has the attributes attr2 and attr3, the line representing obj1 should look as follows: <em>obj1:attr2;attr3</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      In addition ConExp allows to reopen documents on which you were working before by selecting one of the items in the sub-menu <em>Files - Reopen</em>.
      </p><p></p>

      <strong>Saving a document</strong>
      <p>To save your work, use the menu items <em>Save</em>  and <em>Save as</em>  in the menu <em>Files</em> or select the button <em>Save file</em> on the main toolbar. The recommended storage format is native ConExp format <em>*.cex</em>.</p>

      <title>Working on a context</title>
      <strong>Undo/redo support</strong>
      <p>ConExp provides undo/redo support for all doings that were performed on the context. One can undo the performed actions by selecting the <em>Undo last action</em> button on context editor's toolbar and redo by pressing the <em>Redo last action</em>  button.</p>
      <strong>Changing size of a context</strong>
      <p>For changing the size of context one should use the properties window on the left hand side of the main frame and enter new numbers for objects/attributes as properties in <em>object count/ attribute count</em>. Moreover, it is possible to add new objects (attributes) into the context by pressing the corresponding button <em>Add object</em> or <em>Add attribute</em>  on context editor's toolbar.</p>
      <p>In order to remove some set of objects/attributes, select them in context editor and then perform <em>Remove object(s)/Remove attribute(s)</em>  action from context editor's context menu.</p> 
      <strong>Compressed view of a context</strong>
      <p>Selecting the <em>Compressed</em> option on the context editor's property pane, gives a better overview on the context, especially when it is large. Then the width of context's columns will be set just to fit the size of the cross and one can have a better look at the structure of context.</p> 
      <strong>Visualization of the arrow relations</strong>
      <p>To visualise arrow relations change the property  <em>show arrow relation</em>  from <em>don't show</em> to <em>show arrow relation</em>. As we do not want to introduce any theory here, we refer to the book of Ganter and Wille \cite{FCA-Book} for the definition and usage of the arrow relations.</p> 
      <strong>Entering data into the context</strong>
      <p><em>Fast editing of contexts</em>: If one needs to input a context of moderate size, one can use the so-called fast context editing.</p>
 
      <p>For this, just use the keys <em>x</em>  and <em>.</em> . A cross or blanc value will be entered accordingly, when staying in an appropriate cell and the cursor will move to the next cell in relation area.</p>
      <p><em>Transformations on selected areas</em>: After marking an area of cells one can transform the content of the incidence relation between objects and attributes. The following transformations are supported:
      <ul>
         <li><em>Fill selection</em>: This fills the selected area of the incidence relation with crosses.</li>
         <li><em>Clear selection</em>: This option clears the content of the selected area.</li>
         <li><em>Inverse selection</em>: Here a cross is replaced by a blanc value and vice-versa.</li>
      </ul>
All these transformations can be performed by using the appropriate command from context menu.</p> <p></p>
      <strong>Operations on contexts</strong>
      <p>Following operations can be performed on contexts:</p> 
      <ul>
         <li><em>Object clarification</em>: This option brings together all objects in the context having equal sets of attributes. The resulting context shows the first occurrence of those rows only. This operation is executed by the help of the button <em>Clarify objects</em> on the context editor's toolbar.</li>
         
         <li><em>Object set reduction</em>: Removing all objects from the set of object set that can be obtained as a result of intersection of some other objects is called reduction. In process of performing reduction clarification is also performed. This operation does not change the structure of the concept lattice. Speaking mathematically, the concept lattice of the reduced context is isomorphic to the concept lattice of the original context. This operation is performed by pressing the button <em>Reduce objects</em>  on the context editor's toolbar.</li>
         <li><em>Attribute set reduction</em>: This is the analogous operation on the set of attribute. It is performed after selecting the <em>Reduce attributes</em> button on context editor's toolbar.</li>
         <li><em>Context reduction</em>: Both operations (reduction of the object and attribute set) can be done simultaneously by executing <em>Reduce context</em>  button on context editor's toolbar.</li>
         <li><em>Transposition</em>: Exchanging the role of objects and attribute set together with the corresponding changes of the relation between them, can be performed by selecting the <em>Transpose context</em>  button on context editor's toolbar. </li>
       </ul>
