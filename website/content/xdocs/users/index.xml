      <title>The theory behind</title>
      <p>ConExp implements basic ideas needed for the study and research of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).</p>
      <p>Formal Concept Analysis provides the mathematical theory and belonging to algebra it is a branch of lattice theory. Starting point for this development were the early 1980-ies in Darmstadt by members of a group around Rudolf Wille.</p>
       <p>ConExp can be used for analysing simple attribute-object-tables (called formal context in FCA), drawing the corresponding concept lattice and to explore different dependencies, that exists between attributes.</p>

      <title>What does ConExp do?</title>
      <p>ConExp provides the following tools:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>context editing,</li>
         <li> building concept lattices from a formal context,</li>
         <li> finding a base for implications that are true in formal context,</li>
         <li> finding a base of association rules that are true in formal context and</li>
         <li> performing attribute exploration.</li>
         </ul>

      <title>A short history</title>
      <p>ConExp was first developed as a part of a master thesis under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Tatyana Taran at the National Technical University of Ukraine ``KPI'' in 2000. During the following years, it has been extended several times and now it is an open source project on <link href="http://www.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</link>.
