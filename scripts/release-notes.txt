Release notes to version 1.1 of "Concept Explorer"
==================================================

The following new functionality was added in release 1.1
compared to 1.0.1:
- ability to build concept lattice by selected object subset
  (thanks to Tim Kaiser to implementing major part of it)
- fast input mode for editing context (now pressing "X" and "."
  allows to input new value to context and move to the next cell).
- cut/copy/paste support for context editing

Several bugs were fixed:
- attribute exploration input dialogs
  * not transfering value, entered at object name section of context
  editor, when one of the buttons in dialog is pressed
  * exception, that appeared if dialog was closed via "X" button on top

- lattice drawing pane
  * bug, connected with absence of reaction on change of some values in
    drawing parameters pane
  * bug - dragging node of lattice outside of visible area can lead to
    image of lattice to jump in 0.0 point (thanks to Julian Tane) for
    contributing patch

We are glad to welcome two new members of ConExp team -
Tim Kaiser and Julian Tane.
